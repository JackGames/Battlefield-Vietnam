# Battlefield Vietnam

Battlefield Vietnam is an FPS (First Person Shooter) game based on the true-to-life Vietnam War. Choose your team: US/South Vietnam (Blue Team) or North Vietnam (Red Team). Play singleplayer missions/levels that are basically battles in different parts of Vietnam OR play multiplayer by creating or joining one. You can also make a BF:V Server using DedicatedServer.exe or you can also play the official servers. EDIT: Official servers are now shut down! Sorry for the inconvenience!
